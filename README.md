## How It Works ü§ì

- **Select a Drink:** The program prompts the user to choose a coffee drink from the menu. You can select from options like espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

- **Resource Management:** The program manages the availability of resources such as water, milk, and coffee beans. It checks if there are enough resources to brew the selected coffee.

- **Payment Processing:** Users are asked to insert virtual coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies). The program calculates the total amount received and checks if the payment is sufficient for the selected coffee.

- **Change Calculation:** If the payment is sufficient, the program calculates and returns any change to the user.

- **Brewing Coffee:** Once the payment is successful and resources are available, the coffee machine brews the selected drink.

- **Reporting:** Users can request a financial report that displays the status of resources (water, milk, coffee) and the amount of money earned by the coffee machine.

- **Turn Off:** Users can turn off the coffee machine when they are done using it.
